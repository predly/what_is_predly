# Introducing Predly: How our technology enables high resolution weather forecasting

Weather forecasting models need observation data to determine the atmospheres condition. The more observations, the better the forecast.

In Berlin, there are only 5 government weather stations for an area of > 880 km² to provide ground observation data. That means, there is only 1 observation per ~180 km². The American leading forecast system GFS can only predict 1 value for an area of 156.25 km³. The best resolution model by Germany's DWD (COSMO model) predicts in 4 km² grids, but relies on the same ground observation data.

## Example location: Berlin

Area: 89894.76 ha (898.9476km²)

At Predly, we use sensors from various new data sources, resulting in over 1000 ground observations, just for Berlin. That means, we have 1 observation per 0.83 km² in average.

With our algorithms, we clean and aggregate the data into a 75 m resolution.
